hello everyone, my name is phan thanh tu , i'm 22 years old,i was born in nghe an provin, i'm a senior at university of 
transportation and comunication,my major is electronics and telecommunications

in my school,i have some projects like "smart door opening and closing control system, fire alarm system by phone". 
In these projects i use rf24 communication technology and esp8266 hardware to implementation, 
I also had some problems with these projects such as:
having to learn new communication knowledge.....
learning new hardware technologies,finally we finished the project.

One of my strong points is Being responsible, in my school,when I work in a group I always try to complete my tasks well 
and help other members complete their tasks.My weakness is that I am not confident in public when speaking English,
I signed up for more courses to improve this.

My short term goal is within the next 2 months, after completing my course at FA, to become a professional embedded programmer.and
my long term goal is within the next 4 to 5 years to become a leader in fptsw.
